# NAEP_Data_Mining
Use a dataset provided by Educational Testing Service. 

This dataset is a deidentified compilation of actions students made during testing in the 2016-2017 academic year. The students worked on "blocks" of test math problems, referred to as Blocks A and B. Each block contains a set number of problems and each student had a 30 minute time limit to complete the problems in each block. Once the 30 minutes are completed, students are automatically dismissed from the block, regardless of how many problems they have completed.
